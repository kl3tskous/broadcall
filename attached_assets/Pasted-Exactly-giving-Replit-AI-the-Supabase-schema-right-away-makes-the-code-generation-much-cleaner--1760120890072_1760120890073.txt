üß† Prompt for Replit AI ‚Äì Build MVP for Coin Call Referral Platform

Build a Next.js + Tailwind CSS web app with a dark modern UI for a simple influencer coin-call referral platform (Solana-focused).

Features to include in this first version:

1. Project Setup
	‚Ä¢	Use Next.js and Tailwind CSS (dark theme).
	‚Ä¢	Create a clean folder structure:

/pages
  index.jsx
  call/[id].jsx
/components
  WalletConnectButton.jsx
  CallForm.jsx
/utils
  supabaseClient.js


	‚Ä¢	Include Solana Wallet Adapter to support Phantom wallet login on the homepage.
	‚Ä¢	Use Supabase as the database (frontend client).

‚∏ª

2. Supabase Setup

Use this database schema for a calls table:

create table calls (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  creator_wallet text not null,
  token_address text not null,
  platform text not null,
  thesis text,
  views int default 0,
  clicks int default 0,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);


‚∏ª

3. Homepage (/)
	‚Ä¢	Show a ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù button (Phantom via Solana Wallet Adapter).
	‚Ä¢	Once connected, display the user‚Äôs wallet address.
	‚Ä¢	Show a simple form:
	‚Ä¢	Input: Token Address (text)
	‚Ä¢	Input: Thesis (optional textarea)
	‚Ä¢	Hidden field or default value: platform = "GMGN"
	‚Ä¢	Generate Link button
	‚Ä¢	On submit:
	‚Ä¢	Insert a new record in the calls table using Supabase.
	‚Ä¢	Use a placeholder referral code: 7rpqjHdf.
	‚Ä¢	After saving, show a generated link:

https://your-app.com/call/[id]

(where [id] is the Supabase record ID).

‚∏ª

4. Call Page (/call/[id])
	‚Ä¢	Fetch the call data by ID from Supabase.
	‚Ä¢	Display:
	‚Ä¢	Token address
	‚Ä¢	Thesis (if available)
	‚Ä¢	Embedded GMGN chart iframe (dark mode):

https://www.gmgn.cc/kline/sol/[TOKEN_ADDRESS]?theme=dark


	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúBuy via GMGN‚Äù button linking to:

https://t.me/gmgnaibot?start=i_7rpqjHdf_sol_[TOKEN_ADDRESS]


	‚Ä¢	Increment the views counter when the page loads.
	‚Ä¢	Increment the clicks counter when the buy button is clicked.

‚∏ª

5. UI / Design
	‚Ä¢	Use Tailwind CSS for a sleek dark theme:
	‚Ä¢	Background: dark gray / black
	‚Ä¢	Text: light gray / white
	‚Ä¢	Accent: bright color (blue, green, or purple)
	‚Ä¢	Mobile-friendly layout.
	‚Ä¢	Clean, modern, minimalist design.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Requirements Recap
	‚Ä¢	Next.js + Tailwind project scaffold
	‚Ä¢	Phantom wallet connect via Solana Wallet Adapter
	‚Ä¢	Supabase client integration
	‚Ä¢	Call creation form + link generation
	‚Ä¢	Call page with token info, chart, and referral button
	‚Ä¢	View and click tracking in Supabase
	‚Ä¢	Simple, dark, modern UI

Start by coding the base project structure, Supabase client setup, wallet connect component, and homepage with form.

‚∏ª

üëâ This gives Replit AI everything it needs to:
	‚Ä¢	set up the codebase properly,
	‚Ä¢	configure Supabase usage,
	‚Ä¢	and build your MVP cleanly from the start.

Would you like me to also prepare a follow-up prompt for after the first build (e.g. ‚Äúmake the design look more premium / animated‚Äù)? That often helps polish the UI after the base version is working. üöÄ
